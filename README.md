# Breast-cancer
A research about breast cancer from Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set

# Abstract
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers, accounting for many fatalities each year.
Breast cancer is accounting for approximately one-third of all cancer diagnoses in the US.
Breast cancer is caused by a tumor or abnormal growth of cells in the breast tissue. It is a
classification problem because tumors are classified as benign (non-cancerous), pre-malignant
(cancerous), or malignant (cancerous). Breast cancer screening is crucial in the early stages of
cancer disease. Thus, it is a severe concern in the more significant domain space. Classification
of data into two types of breast cancer is an efficient tool for studying cancer. In healthcare,
classification is the most common method in diagnosis and decision-making.
The main goal is to evaluate the integrity of data classification for each algorithm's
evaluation metrics in terms of accuracy, precision, sensitivity, and specificity. We used
powerful algorithms to categorize the data, including logistic regression, QDA (Quadratic
discriminant analysis), K-NN (K-nearest neighbor), Neural network, SVM, and decision tree.
The main question investigated is whether these machine-learning algorithms are Useful in
detecting tumor cell types. As per the findings, classification aids in detecting the proper
kinds of tumor cells.
# Problem and motivation
There are still many challenges with a cancer diagnosis despite a significant number of medical
studies and technological breakthroughs that contribute to cancer treatment. In women, breast
cancer is the most important cause of death. Breast cancer arises in the inner lining of milk
ducts or in the lobules that provide milk to the Ducts. An increase in nuclear radiation,
chemicals in the air, bacteria, fungi, electromagnetic radiation, viruses, parasites, heat, water,
food, mechanical cell-level injury, free radicals, evolution, and aging of DNA and RNA could
all cause normal cells to transform into cancer cells through a metamorphosis or alteration of
DNA or RNA. Therefore, it is crucial to diagnose breast cancer cells appropriately. Besides,
most breast tumors are formed by benign (non-cancerous) modifications, whereas
misdiagnosing a malignant tumor as Benign might result in severe consequences. This final project aims to determine if malignancies should be reasonably
classified as B or M. The goal is to create a reliable classification algorithm that will drastically
reduce the incidence of breast cancer.
# Data Description
The final project is based on the Wisconsin (diagnostic) breast cancer data set. We have
previously used the UCI machine learning repository for several projects and appreciate their
commitment to delivering a quality data set. The final project aims to study data from women
in Wisconsin to determine whether breast cancer is malignant or benign. The original data set
consists of [569*32] dimension, where 32 are the features, and they were computed by a
digitized image of a fine needle aspirate (FNA) of a breast mass. They exhibit characteristics
of the cell nuclei seen in the imaging.
